    "Moreover, we also need to normalize the dataset such that all of the scores are bound to similar scales. Note that in the dataset, there are several features, such as the song duration (dur) and beats per minute (bpm) which is much bigger compared to the values of the other features. If the dataset were not to be scaled, the model designed will emphasize more on those aforementioned features, hence it will result in a big bias towards those features. Consequently, our regression model could be inaccurate."
